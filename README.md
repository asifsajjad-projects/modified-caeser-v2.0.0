# modified-caeser-v2.0.0
This project is aimed to make weak passwords strong and the user do not have to use any external password manager. 

This is a small webapp in which the user will enter the usual weak passwords easy to remember and it will automatically generate a strong password and copy to the clipboard. There is a provision to add key specific to the site for which password will be generated (eg. name, type etc.). This key will act as user specific differentiator so that no one (not even the developers) will be able to decrypt the password if they somehow get access to it.

The implementation can be found at [Hidden Caeser](https://adamsinnovationlab.in/hiddenCaeser.html 'ADAMS Innovation Lab')

Feel free to contribute.
